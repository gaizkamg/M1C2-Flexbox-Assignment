# M1C2-Flexbox-Assignment
**Checkpoint 2 of Module 1**


During the second section of Module 1, you will have learned about Git. Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to take control of their workflow. Git can help us work with others, display our code online, and work on the same project from different computers. It can also help us keep track of different versions of our project and work on different features. Please complete the following assignment and reach out on the Support App to have a mentor review your work. If you have any questions or need any help, please reach out so we can help you! This assignment must be completed to pass this section of the coursework. 

*Concepts Included in this Assignment: Git, Github, repositories, command line/terminal.*

Assignment: In this assignment, you will use git to upload your M1C2 Flexbox Assignment to Github.

Start by navigating into the project directory in your terminal/command prompt. You should have a new folder for each project you do for the entire course. Use the command “git init” to initialize your empty repository. 

Go to Github and create a new repository. Copy and paste the line given to you by github that begins with “git remote add origin”. Run that command in your terminal/command prompt. Run the commands to add all of the changes, commit them, and push them up to Github. Reach out with a ticket to show a mentor your git repository on github!
